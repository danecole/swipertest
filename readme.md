This is a [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) web component that should work in most modern browsers.

Tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge (Insider Build)

# Built with Stencil

[Stencil](https://stenciljs.com) is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Using The Component
You can insert your own images and URLs. The component logic will take care of the layout and sizing

Inserting text should work although you'll need to do your own text styling

Here's a [Demo](http://danecole.com/swipertest/)!
